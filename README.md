## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Solution retrospective

I wanted to make my code efficient and maintainable by defining global variables in the :root (such as fonts, colors, and spacing). It was really satisfying to write code faster this way.

For the product photo, I noticed in the mobile version of the Figma design that the image wasnâ€™t properly centered and had been manually repositioned along the X and Y axes for aesthetic purposes. To match the design, I used the object-position CSS property, which allowed me to replicate the original look.

I would be grateful for any kind of feedback!
