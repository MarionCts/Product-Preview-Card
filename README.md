## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS components
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I experimented with margin-block and margin-inline (instead of margin-top/left/bottom/right) to get a more responsive design if the page were to be translated into a different language that requires different alignments (like reading from right to left for exemple). It was really satisfying to discover a new way to set spacings.

### Continued development

I want to get more confortable with responsive design.
